##HackAE - Solar Saver Web Application

## Inspiration

We wanted to help clean the world and use natural resources to create a better and brighter future.

## What it does

Solar Saver uses data from National Renewable Energy Labs and Google Geocoding to decide if solar is a viable option for your house or business.

## How we built it

We used Google Geocoding API to search a location, get latitude and longitude and then compare it to data returned from National Renewable Energy Labs API to decide if using solar panels is a viable option.

## Challenges we ran into

It was quite difficult to integrate the NREL API and Google's Geocoding API together in our application. Also, it took us some time to create equations and formulas to decide if solar is viable.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are really proud of the end product because it is stable and ready for production. It is built with responsive design in mind so the web app looks great on all screen sizes.

## What we learned

We learned how to use multiple API's and build a responsive website..
